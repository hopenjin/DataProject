# My Data Analystics Project List

###  This is the place that I will continually post my latest data analytics projects. I will keep updating them and adding something new. My goal is to make at least five projects related different machine learning topics, such as, NLP, CV, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning. For now, it is just beginning. Thank you for your time to read.
